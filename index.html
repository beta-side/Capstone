    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      As a certified Product Owner I use the Agile <b>SCRUM</b> framework, to
      improve customer relations with expected results. As a software developer,
      I create API’s for business tasks, integration points between systems, or
      independent platforms. I have worked at Belize’s largest
      telecommunications company as a software developer for the past 8 years. I
      have combined these skills to effectively deliver software projects.

    <h3>Work Experience</h3>
    <p>
      <i>MAR 2023 - PRESENT</i><br />
      <b>Product Owner / Belize Telemedia Limited, Belize City, Belize</b><br />
      As Product Owner at BTL, I managed and oversaw two critical integration
      projects: Office Track and Middleware. For Office Track, I managed teams
      to receive training on the Workforce Management System and integrate it
      into BTL's billing system. On Middleware, I developed a system from
      scratch with documentation, expandability, security, efficiency, and
      accuracy in mind. I trained staff on operability, expandability, and
      installation, and developed clear and concise documentation for
      stakeholders. I demonstrated my ability to lead and manage complex
      initiatives, meeting the needs of the business and stakeholders.

      <i>Aug 2014 - MAR 2023</i><br />
      <b>Software Developer / Belize Telemedia Limited, Belize City, Belize</b
      ><br />
      As the lead programmer for the MIDDLEWARE (MW) project at Belize Telemedia
      Limited (BTL), my primary responsibility is to oversee the integration of
      multiple systems into BTL's billing system, MIND CTI. Utilizing REST and
      SOAP APIs, we have successfully integrated over 13 companies, including
      major technology partners such as Huawei, Cisco, FNT, Airvantage,
      Microsoft, Oracle, and local businesses such as banks and collection
      agencies. In this role, I have led the integration of a variety of
      systems, including resource management, customer relationship management
      (CRM), and billing systems. To ensure optimal functionality and security,
      my focus has been on maintaining business rules and implementing
      appropriate security measures. Overall, my work on the MW project has been
      integral to BTL's success in maintaining efficient and secure operations,
      and I look forward to continuing to contribute to the company's ongoing
      development and growth.
