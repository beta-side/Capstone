<p>
  I successfully launched the Office Track workforce management system as a
  Product Owner from July to November 2021. In this role, I effectively
  coordinated with stakeholders, managed resources, led testing and training,
  and ensured the product was deployed to production. This achievement
  demonstrates my ability to deliver results on time and within budget. As a
  Product Owner I have expanded my responsibilities to include user story
  development, scrum planning, and backlog refinement. Additionally, I am
  committed to improving my skills and knowledge through personal development
  courses, in order to further enhance my performance as a Product Owner.
